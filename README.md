# Signup-Form
## This is a front-end view of a mock sign-up page.

### Created using  **HTML** , **CSS**  and **JS**.

This was a much more HTML and CSS focused project, with an increased use of flexbox, CSS properties being set and modified and Emmet properties, which have made typing code much easier.

I have also implemented concepts such as form validation, in both CSS and JS, in an easy to understand and fix format for anybody who interacts with it.

Issues: Cannot figure out how to set the side banner. 

[Update: Fixed]

This is part of my ongoing practice of web development through the [Odin Project]("https://www.theodinproject.com")

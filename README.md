# Signup-Form
## This is a front-end view of a mock sign-up page.

### Created using  **HTML** , **CSS**  and **JS**.

This was a much more HTML and CSS focused project, with an increased use of flexbox, CSS properties being set and modified and Emmet properties, which have made typing code much easier.

I have also implemented concepts such as form validation, in both CSS and JS, in an easy to understand and fix format for anybody who interacts with it.

Also implemented some REGEX in the HTML to ensure better form validation.

Most of the issues for this project were based on the CSS side of the project, the JS can also be simplified, but as this project is HTML and CSS based, I will work on a revision including more JS, once I finish working on other projects.

Issues: Cannot figure out how to set the side banner. 

[Update: Fixed]
